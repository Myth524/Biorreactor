## **Description**:
This thesis project involves the development of a software prototype for the control and monitoring of a stirred tank bioreactor. The system is built using FXML, Java, CSS, and JavaFX with the aid of Scene Builder for the design of the graphical user interface (GUI). The software prototype aims to simulate and visualize key processes within a bioreactor, such as agitation speed, temperature, and pH control, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and adjustments.

## **Key Features:**
**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Designed using JavaFX and FXML, with Scene Builder used for layout creation and customization. CSS is applied to style the interface, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing design.

**Process Simulation:** The software allows users to simulate key operational parameters of a stirred tank bioreactor, such as:
- Agitation speed
- Temperature control
- pH regulation
- Nutrient supply

**Real-time Monitoring:** Users can track the changes in the system in real-time, visualizing the effect of parameter adjustments on the bioreactor's performance.

**Interactive Controls:** The interface includes interactive controls for users to input or adjust parameters and immediately see the impact on the system's operation.

## **Technologies Used**
**JavaFX:** For building the graphical user interface and providing real-time interaction.
**FXML:** For defining the structure of the interface.
**CSS:** Used for customizing the appearance of the software.
**Java:** The core language used to implement the business logic and process control.
**Scene Builder:** For visually designing the interface layout.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the creation of a functional prototype for a stirred tank bioreactor control system, providing a foundation for further development and real-world application in bioprocessing industries. The use of JavaFX and FXML ensures flexibility and scalability, while the intuitive GUI allows users to easily simulate and monitor the bioreactor’s performance in real time.
